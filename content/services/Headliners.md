  Headliners are generally easy to give an accurate price quote on because they mostly seem to have the same problem, the fabric hangs down near the front or back windshield. 
  Some customers ask if the fabric can simply be re-attached to the roof?
  The answer? Not if you want it done right!
  The reason the fabric hangs down is because the foam backing, “which is bonded to the headliner fabric” has deteriorated due to heat and humidity.  A headliners primary use is to provide some insulation from the weather and sound outside your vehicle.
  Another common question is, “why did my headliner come down so soon?
  The most common headliners we see in newer vehicles are Volkswagen and Honda.  They seem have used headliner fabrics that don’t hold up in the Texas climate.  All headliners will drop in time but those two seem to happen sooner rather than later.

  Sunroofs 
  The pricing for sunroofs is separate from the headliner pricing because they are two separate operations.  
  If you only need your sunroof repaired and not the headliner, the price may be more. Often the headliner needs to be dropped to access the sunroof assembly.
  If you have any water leaks comming form the sunroof we can check that as well.  Often if you live in an area with a lot of trees, leaves and sediment will clog the sunroof drain holes.

  Sun visors
  Some sun visors we cannot reupholster because they are made of a molded plastic.  We will try and locate replacements for these.
  Sun visors with mirrors and valence lights
  Due to the age of the plastic parts, there is a possibility that the sun visor mirror and valance lights may not be salvageable. We can still reupholster the sun visors but you may lose those functions.
