  If your auto carpet is dirty or torn or stinks, we can help!

  Two options for replacement of auto carpet
  Option #1   O.E.M. original equipment manufactured part. If it's still available, we can order you an original carpet thru the dealership. This is the best option for a “perfect fit” and color match.  O.E.M carpets are generally more expensive than aftermarket carpets.

  Option #2   Aftermarket molded carpet.  These aftermarket carpets are often the only option when the dealer no longer supplies the O.E.M part.  They are molded to fit the floor of the vehicle but generally have some wrinkles and the colors will be close but not exact.  

  Options for repairing and cleaning carpets
  One of the most common repairs we perform on carpets is installing a new heel pad to the driver’s floor area.  The carpet usually wears thin where the drivers foot rest.  Over time a hole will open up and the floorboard can be seen. A “heel pad” is a durable rectangular vinyl pad that absorbs the brunt of wear from your foot.  We have many different sizes and colors in stock.

  We can also repair some tears in the carpet, but sometimes they just need to be replaced.

  Cleaning Carpets
  If you have a dirty, stinky but intact carpet we can pressure wash it!  When we pressure wash a carpet, we completely disassemble the interior seats, consoles and trim.  Once the carpet is removed, we hang it outside and pressure wash it, then we let it dry and replace the jute padding.  We clean the floorboard of the vehicle and if the car has acquired a bad smell, mold or mildew we can perform a Chlorine dioxide treatment which kills mold, mildew and bacteria. For more information just give us a call!
