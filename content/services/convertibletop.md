  Convertibles require different care than normal vehicles.  If you treat a convertible like a normal vehicle, you will be damaging you top and interior without realizing it.  Here are some treats and tricks to help keep your convertible in tip top condition! 

  Washing your convertible
  Most car washes add degreaser to their water.  This is meant to help remove grime dirt and bugs from the body of your vehicle. But this will also damage a convertible top!  Tops are made out of a Vinyl or Canvass material, along with different types of plastics, threading and heat-sealed glass.  Degreasers will break down these components and over time destroy your top!  Also, the power of pressurized water hitting the top can easily cause scarring of the fabric and delamination of the rear window!
  We recommend hand washing your convertible, either at home or at your local auto detailer. 
  You can go to a self-service car wash and just use the pressure washer on the body of the car and wash the top by hand later. Avoid drive thru car washes! If you attempt to take your convertible thru a drive thru, make sure to wear you swim suit or bring your rubber ducky!

  Protecting your Convertible
  Most cars spend the majority of their life outside.  Over time you will see the effects of this exposure in the paint job.  The color will oxidize, fade, and the clear coat will crack and flake off.  Although it’s not pretty you can still drive off without being exposed to the elements.   
  If a convertible top is exposed but never treated properly, it will dry rot, crack and eventually tear.  Once you have a holy convertible top you better pray it never rains!  Stop by Peña Brothers and pick up some of the quality products we have found.  We have cleaning products to help remove tree sap, tar, bird stuff, etc…   We carry RAGGTOPP fabric protectant that will seal your top, repel water and keep your cloth top from dry rotting.  We also carry RAGGTOPP Vinyl Protectant with UV protection, which will keep your vinyl top flexible and protected from the hot Texas sun!

  Rear Plastic windows
  Did you know that using a standard window cleaner will ruin a plastic window?  Standard window cleaners cause plastic windows to permanently fog up, and ruin your view.  Usually once the rear window is ruined, we have to replace the complete convertible top.  Come visit us and save your plastic window! We carry RAGGTOPP plastic window cleaner and protection kits too!

  Convertible Drainage systems
  Did you know that all convertible tops leak water into the car?  It’s true!  Convertibles are designed with a system of drainage channels. The channels allow water to flow thru the body of the car and out the bottom!  Often over time, sediment can build up in these channels and reduce the flow of water.  With clogged channels and heavy rains, the passenger compartment will become flooded.
  If your interior floods, stop by Pena Brothers!  We have the tools and the know how to clear your convertibles drainage systems and get your interior cleaned and dried out, before mold and mildew set in.

  We’ve been working on convertible tops for over 30 years and have seen and learned a lot.  Just give us a call or an email and we will do our best to help!
