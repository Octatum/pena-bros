  - title: LEXOL Leather Conditioner and Preservative
    description: >-
      LEXOL is a liquid conditioner and preservative intended for use in the
      care and conservation of leather. Its purpose is to maintain the strength,
      beauty, utility and flexibility of leather - old and new - and to restore
      resiliency to old or neglected leather that has become hardened and stiff.
  - title: LEXOL-pH Leather Cleaner
    description: >-
      A blend of selected, non-alkaline cleaning agents designed to clean
      leather safely and thoroughly without the harshness or potentially
      damaging effects of saddle soaps, which are alkaline. The formula is based
      on the principle of breaking up and removing the oils, which trap dirt in
      the leather while its foaming action lifts out the embedded dirt, leaving
      the leather with a clean, alkaline-free environment.

      art, protectant including DH60 UV sunscreen Traditional vinyl protectants
      do not penetrate to clean, preserve or protect as Vinylex does.
