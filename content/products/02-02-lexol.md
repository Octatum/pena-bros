      One of the best products we have carried for over 20 years is LEXOL leather cleaner.  Just apply the cleaner with a damp cloth using circular motions to loosen dirt and grime from the pores of the leather. Afterword’s, use a dry cloth to remove the residual.

      It's very important to follow leather cleaning with a good conditioner! Lexol leather conditioner replenishes the natural oils in the leather and keep it flexible and soft.  Without regular conditioning of leather, cracks and tears will occur much sooner in the life of your seats.
