  The work is excellent and the material was matched perfectly.  Iâ€™m very impressed with the quality of workmanship and the customer service was outstanding.  The staff, especially Rudy, was super friendly and Rudy explained the whole process thoroughly.  I will definitely use them for any upholstery or headliner work in the future!
