  Wonderful experience having the headliner replaced in my Dodge Dakota truck!  They were able to fit me in the day after I called to make an appointment, and the work was done in less than 24 hours!  The headliner now looks amazing, and they left the inside of the truck vacuumed and pristine!  Everyone was so friendly and easy to deal with!  The shop is on the other side of town from me, but it was totally worth the drive! I will be taking all of my auto upholstery needs to Pena!
